What is you site's primary purpose?

The purpose of my site is to document my weekly blogs about assignments, progress, learnings and journey through the 18 weeks Dev Academy course.


Who is your target audience?

My teachers, peers and wider audience who have an interest on my progress and whom would like to see a personal inside look at some of the things taught in the curriculum.


How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want them to feel like my site is a personal blog, so some aesthetics I want to come across is the visuals of what a diary looks and feels like. They should be able to navigate between blog entries easily and focused on the content easily.


How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I would include elements such as:
- easy navigation buttons
- chronological order of blogs, to emulate a journey/timeline
- clear headings and font size
- a visually appealing colour scheme
- focus on content and not rely on images overload
